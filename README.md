> Traffic Coordination:  
- Innovate ways to coordinate traffic across different modes of transport, ensuring smooth transitions and reducing bottlenecks at key points in the city.  

> Smart Parking Solutions:  
- Innovate parking technologies that optimize the use of available spaces, reduce search time for parking, and integrate with city planning tools.  

> Public Transport Efficiency:  
- Create solutions to improve the scheduling, routing, and capacity management of public transportation, making it a more appealing option for residents.  

> Vehicle Pollution Control:  
- Address environmental concerns by proposing solutions that help reduce emissions from vehicles, especially in congested areas.

## Twasonga  
- Twasonga is a swahili word that translates to let's move, this is a project
  that focuses on the Public Transport Efficiency challenge.
- It addresses this by making it easy for commuters to book a bus seat anytime
  they wish to commute so as to ensure that at any moment only 3 buses are at
  the bus stop.  
- Nairobi oftenly experiences traffic jams due to a lot of buses wanting to
  access the CBD at once and for some of the times, they are empty buses.
- By having only three buses at a bus stop, 2 loading passengers and one
  offloading passengers and the rest in transit or at a set loation outside the
  CBD.
- This solution promises to help bus saccos in fleet management while also
  making it more convenient for commuters when in need of commuting.  
- By having it as a USSD code ensures inclsivity of all devices whether
  smartphones or as we call them 'kabambes'.
